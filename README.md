This project concerns building a digital marketplace that will serve as a meeting point for buyers and sellers of NFTs to come together and trade, the Marketplace will display a gallery of collectibles with their respective prices
and bidding details, similar to everyday art auctions. We will be trying to facilitate an easy exchange of value-able assets on the ethereum network. The idea is for any user to use their crypto-wallets to log-in to our website
and then be able to easily Mint an NFT for sale or bid for an NFT in the marketplace gallery. Since the NFT has recently gotten alot of attention as more and more people realize the value of it, this has led to a boom in the
NFT market and has shown glimpses of a future paradigm shift in the art world.
